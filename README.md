## 📖 How We Used Authentic Skincare Sources

To make MOAI a *credible and safe skincare assistant, only **reliable, peer-reviewed, or medically backed sources* were used when training the chatbot inside Botpress.

### 🧠 Sources Integrated:

- *World Health Organization (WHO)* – Global skincare safety guidelines
- *American Academy of Dermatology (AAD.org)* – Skin condition info, treatment methods
- *Paula’s Choice Skincare Library* – Ingredients analysis & skincare routines

### 📚 How We Trained the Bot:

1. *Knowledge Bases (Botpress Cloud)*
   - Direct links to specific WHO & AAD articles were added as sources.
   - Structured FAQs were created from credible dermatology blogs & medical wikis.

2. *Q&A + Intents*
   - Example: Questions like “Is salicylic acid good for oily skin?” answer using facts from these sources.

3. *Bot Personality*
   - Answers are simplified to match Gen Z tone while retaining accuracy.
   - Suggestions always encourage patch tests or dermatology consults.
